# Conway's Game of Life

What is the project?


- Every cell interacts with its surrounding eight neighbors. Horizontally, 
Vertically, Diagonally and Adjacent.

Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
All other live cells die in the next generation. All dead cells stay dead.



What problem does it solve?

Exceptional difficulties and solutions, if any.

TODO list/wishlist. What do you want to add to it if you have more time?
