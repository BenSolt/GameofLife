- Conway's Game of Life, (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is a cellular automaton created by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

- cellular automaton - 


What problem does it solve?

- Every cell interacts with its surrounding eight neighbors. Horizontally, Vertically, Diagonally and Adjacent.

- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
- Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
- All other live cells die in the next generation. All dead cells stay dead.


Exceptional difficulties and solutions, if any.
